# PitchDay
This is the companion app for the Novus Club web portal. It allows judges to sign into the application, view student submissions, and assign both comments and scores as they are reviewing student submissions.

# Installation
This app can be downloaded on the app store for free. Users who sign up through the app will be unverified and therefore unable to view and score student entries until an administrator has verified them as a judge through the Novus portal.

# AWS Branch
The AWS branch of this application utilizes Amplify, AWS Authentication, and Cloud storage.

# Firebase Branch
The Firebase branch of this application utilizes Firebase, Firebase Authentication, and Cloud DataStore.
